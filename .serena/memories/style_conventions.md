Code uses logging (Python logging) and docstring-heavy functions, mostly imperative style without strict type hints. Strategies inherit abstract base classes, expect pandas Series/DataFrames, and rely on vectorbt APIs. Follow existing naming (snake_case) and keep docstrings bilingual (Japanese comments) when adding modules. Prefer explicit error handling and avoid swallowing exceptions; cache decorators already used for data fetching.
