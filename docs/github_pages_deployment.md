# Deploying the Technical Analysis UI to GitHub Pages

This guide walks through publishing the Streamlit-based technical analysis UI to GitHub Pages as a static site. The workflow leverages the `streamlit static export` command introduced in Streamlit 1.32 to produce static assets that GitHub Pages can host.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later (matching the version defined in `pyproject.toml`).
- A fork or clone of the `FinanceAnalysys` repository with push access.
- GitHub Pages enabled for the repository (requires repository admin rights).
- Node.js is **not** required; the build uses Streamlit's static exporter.

## 1. Set up the environment

```bash
# Clone the repository if you have not already
git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/FinanceAnalysys.git
cd FinanceAnalysys

# Create and activate a virtual environment (example uses venv)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ðŸ’¡ The repository also exposes a `poetry` configuration. If you prefer Poetry, run `poetry install` instead of using `pip`.

## 2. Verify the application locally

Before exporting the site, confirm the UI behaves as expected:

```bash
streamlit run technical_analysis_app.py
```

Open the provided local URL in your browser, exercise the single-symbol, multi-symbol, and backtesting flows, then stop the server (Ctrl+C) when finished.

## 3. Export a static build for GitHub Pages

Streamlit's static exporter generates the HTML, JavaScript, and asset files that GitHub Pages can host. Export into the `docs/` folder so GitHub Pages can serve directly from the default `main` branch configuration.

```bash
# Remove any old export to keep the folder clean
rm -rf docs/static_site

# Produce a fresh static build
streamlit static export technical_analysis_app.py --output docs/static_site
```

The export command creates a `docs/static_site` directory containing an `index.html` entry point and all static assets required to run the Streamlit app client-side. Keep this folder under version control.

## 4. (Optional) Smoke test the static build locally

You can quickly preview the exported site using Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
cd docs/static_site
python -m http.server 8501
```

Visit `http://localhost:8501` in a browser to confirm the static bundle loads correctly. Stop the server when finished and return to the repository root (`cd ../..`).

## 5. Commit and push the static assets

```bash
git add docs/static_site
git commit -m "Add static Streamlit export for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main
```

If you are using pull requests, push the branch and open a PR instead of committing directly to `main`.

## 6. Configure GitHub Pages

1. Navigate to **Settings â†’ Pages** in your GitHub repository.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to `Deploy from a branch`.
3. Choose the `main` branch and the `/docs` folder.
4. Save the configuration.

GitHub Pages will publish the site at `https://<your-account>.github.io/FinanceAnalysys/` (exact URL depends on your account/organization and custom domain settings). The first deployment may take a couple of minutes.

## 7. Automate future exports (optional)

To keep the static bundle fresh, you can automate the export step by adding a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `streamlit static export` on pushes to `main` or on demand. Commit the generated assets or configure the workflow to push the static files to the `gh-pages` branch.

---

With these steps, your Streamlit-powered technical analysis UI is available through GitHub Pages, enabling stakeholders to explore single-symbol studies, multi-symbol comparisons, and backtesting reports directly from the browser without running Python locally.
